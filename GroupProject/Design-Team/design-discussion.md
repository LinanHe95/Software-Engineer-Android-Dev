### Team Design:

We decided that Marlon&#39;s Diagram was the best of the diagrams presented but just had too much detail. We modified the diagram so that it was simpler to make sure that understanding was clear. We discussed some design considerations from other diagrams and included it here. This includes simplifying the database class, adding methods to each class, moving methods that were once in one class, and the relationships between classes.

### Summary:

We learned the best way for us to communicate and coordinate. We were able to effectively and constructively criticize each other&#39;s work. Through looking at the different diagrams we were able to assess and analyze our own UML designs to ensure good design. We effectively communicated the considerations we made when making our own designs that enabled us to find flaws in our own designs and to find the strengths in our own and each other&#39;s design. We were able to very quickly find a communication method that worked for all of us so that everyone was heard, and so that everyone was able to participate.
